## DSO553 (NoSQL Databases in Big Data) Homework Space

This repo contains Zhiyu Zhang’s DSO553 homework at University of Southern California.

### Introduction to DSO553:

Given the various data sources and structures of data that companies are dealing with today, this course provides the framework and understanding to assess the NoSQL ecosystem holistically and then engage with each at a deep level - adding to their knowledge of database design using relational techniques only. This is a deeply practical course dealing with what is happening in the industry today. It will also equip the student to gain hands on knowledge on two of the most widely used NoSQL databases – Document Database (MongoDB) and Graph database (Neo4j). 

Learning Objectives:
